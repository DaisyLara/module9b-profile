# Module 9B - Custom Profile Component

## Description
This is a React app built with Vite. It contains a profile component styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to use JSX
- How to style with inline CSS
- How to create and render functional components

## Challenges
I was able to use assignment 9A for reference and customized certain things that I wanted to adjust, but I had a hard time being creative enough to add more elements to my file. I tried changing the "px" to "em" because I read that em scaled to the screen, but then it broke everything and the font I referenced moved out of the circle and into the webpage itself. I would need more time to dable with either em or rem.
